# Raisin Class Prediction


Data Set Information:

Images of Kecimen and Besni raisin varieties grown in Turkey were obtained with CVS. A total of 900 raisin grains were used, including 450 pieces from both varieties. These images were subjected to various stages of pre-processing and 7 morphological features were extracted. These features have been classified using three different artificial intelligence techniques.


Attribute Information:

1. Area: Gives the number of pixels within the boundaries of the raisin.
2. Perimeter: It measures the environment by calculating the distance between the boundaries of the raisin and the pixels around it.
3. MajorAxisLength: Gives the length of the main axis, which is the longest line that can be drawn on the raisin.
4. MinorAxisLength: Gives the length of the small axis, which is the shortest line that can be drawn on the raisin.
5. Eccentricity: It gives a measure of the eccentricity of the ellipse, which has the same moments as raisins.
6. ConvexArea: Gives the number of pixels of the smallest convex shell of the region formed by the raisin.
7. Extent: Gives the ratio of the region formed by the raisin to the total pixels in the bounding box.
8. Class: Kecimen and Besni raisin.
